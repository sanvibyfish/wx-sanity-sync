# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a WeChat blog synchronization project (wx-blog-sync) that appears to be in the initial setup phase. The repository is currently empty and awaiting initial development.

## Development Commands

*Note: Commands will be added once package.json and build configuration are established*

Common commands to look for once the project is set up:
- `npm install` or `yarn install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` or `yarn build` - Build for production
- `npm test` or `yarn test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` - Run linting
- `npm run type-check` or `yarn type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Architecture Notes

This project will likely involve:
- WeChat API integration for blog content retrieval
- Content synchronization logic
- Possibly a web interface for management
- Database or file storage for synchronized content

When the codebase is developed, update this file with:
- Specific build and development commands from package.json scripts
- Key architectural patterns and data flow
- Important configuration files and their purposes
- Testing strategy and test running instructions
